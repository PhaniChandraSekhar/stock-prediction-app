# Stock Prediction App Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup - Done
Created project structure with directories for source code, data, models, and tests. Set up virtual environment configuration, requirements.txt with necessary dependencies, and comprehensive README.md with project description and setup instructions.

1. Create project structure - Done
2. Set up virtual environment - Done
3. Create requirements.txt file - Done
4. Set up README.md with project description and setup instructions - Done

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing - Done
Implemented Yahoo Finance data fetching module with extensive functionality for collecting historical stock data. Created comprehensive preprocessing utilities with technical indicators, feature engineering, and sequence preparation for time series forecasting. Added robust visualization tools for data exploration and model evaluation.

1. Create data collection script using Yahoo Finance API - Done
2. Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering - Done
3. Create train-test split functions - Done
4. Add data visualization capabilities - Done

## Phase 3: Model Development - Done
Implemented multiple models for stock prediction, including baseline models (last value, mean value, linear regression, random forest) and an advanced LSTM neural network for time series forecasting. Created comprehensive evaluation metrics and model serialization utilities. Added command-line interfaces for training and prediction.

1. Implement baseline model - Done
2. Train and evaluate LSTM model for time series prediction - Done
3. Implement model evaluation metrics - Done
4. Save and serialize trained model - Done

## Phase 4: API Development
1. Create FastAPI application structure
2. Implement prediction endpoints
3. Add model loading and inference code
4. Document API with Swagger UI

## Phase 5: Streamlit UI
1. Create Streamlit app structure
2. Implement stock selection interface
3. Add visualization of historical data and predictions
4. Integrate with prediction API

## Phase 6: Deployment
1. Create Hugging Face Spaces configuration
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Configure deployment to Hugging Face Spaces
4. Test deployed application

## Phase 7: Documentation and Testing
1. Add comprehensive README documentation
